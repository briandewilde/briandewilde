# Hi there 👋

I've been a software engineer for over **15 years**, with experience at companies like **Oracle**, **Volkswagen**, **VSP**, and now **LinkedIn**.  

Although most of my contributions have historically been in **closed-source projects**, my current role at LinkedIn allows me to contribute a portion of my work to open source.

Please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-dewilde/) for a broader survey of my experience or to contact me.
