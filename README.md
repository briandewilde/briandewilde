# Hi there 👋

I've been a software engineer for over **15 years**, with experience at companies like **Oracle**, **Volkswagen**, **VSP**, and now **LinkedIn**.  

Although most of my contributions have historically been in **closed-source projects**, my current role at LinkedIn allows me to **contribute to open source**.
